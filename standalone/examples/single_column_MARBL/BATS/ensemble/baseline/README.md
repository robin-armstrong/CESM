This folder contains the necessary data to reset the MOM6-BATS simulation in preparation for
re-running the assimilation loop. As such, its contents should not be modified except to generate
or re-generate the files in the RESTART sub-folder. This can be accomplished by running

``../../../../../build/intel/MOM6/MOM6``

from within the present folder.
