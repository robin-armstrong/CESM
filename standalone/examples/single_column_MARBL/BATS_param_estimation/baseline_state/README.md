This folder contains the necessary data to reset the ensemble members in preparation for running MOM6+MARBL with DART. As such, its contents should not be modified except to generate or re-generate the files in the RESTART sub-folder. This can be accomplished by running

``../../../../../build/intel/MOM6/MOM6``

from within the present folder.
